React hooks were added to React in v16.8.0 and React Native in v0.59. Hooks are a built in system for managing state and side-effects in function components. The introduction of hooks was hugely exciting for the community, because before hooks, the only way to do anything even mildly complicated like save component state or do network request, you would have had to use a class component, or wire up redux and thunks or sagas. This is no longer the case! A lot of modern React and React Native applications are written using just function components and React hooks!

Hooks inside React native work _exactly_ the same as in React Native, so if you already know about hooks, you're good to go! Refer to the [react](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) documentation on hooks for more info.

For the majority of use-cases, the only hooks you need are `useState`, `useCallback` and `useEffect`. Let's look into these in detail.

## `useState`

[useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) is for saving and updating state inside the component.

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const [value, setValue] = useState(0);
```

Hooks are placed _inside_ the component, as high as possible, always above the `return` statement. The `useState` hook returns an array of two items which you can name whatever you want: the first one is the current value of the item you're saving, and the second if a function that allows you to update the value. Finally, the `0` we passed in is the initial value for our `value`. This is optional and will default to _undefined_.

In order to update this value, we simply call `setValue` with the new value. This will update `value` to reflect the new value, cause a re-render of the component and your UI will reflect the new state. There are two ways to update the value: you can either pass in a function to use the current value as a reference:

```js
setValue(currentValue => currentValue + 1);
```

or you can simply set the value directly without any reference to the current value:

```js
setValue(1);
```

## `useCallback`

[useCallback](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback) is for any kind of action you may want to perform: be it a state update, a network request or launching a modal.

In our counter example before, we pass in the `onPress` function for incrementing and decrementing the counter directly. It's not so much of a problem, but it might get hard to read if the function was loner. So ideally we'd like to pull the `handleIncrement` and `handleDecrement` functions out of the render, like so:

```js
const handleIncrement = () => setCount(current => current + 1);
const handleDecrement = () => setCount(current => current - 1);

<TouchableOpacity onPress={handleIncrement}>

<TouchableOpacity onPress={handleDecrement}>

```

This works, but the problem is that the constants for `handleIncrement` and `handleDecrement` get re-initialize every time the component re-renders, and because the whole framework is built around being dynamic, this is _a lot_ of times. `useCallback` to the rescue!

```js
import React, { useCallback } from 'react';

const handleIncrement = useCallback(() => {
  setCount(current => current + 1);
}, []);
```

This may be a bit hard to read at first, but you'll soon get used to it it. `useCallback` is a function that takes takes two arguments: the function we want to return (notice this is _exactly_ the function we had before), and an array of values that should trigger the function to be re-initialized. In our case, this array is empty, because the `useState` function is the same, and we're not using any other outside variables inside the `useCallback`. As a rule of thumb, any variables used inside the `useCallback` should be added to the array.

## `useEffect`

[useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) is tied to the component render cycle. If you're already familiar with React Components, you can think of this as `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`.

There are two main types of use-cases for `useEffect`: ones that require cleanup and ones that don't.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, status => setIsOnline(status.isOnline);

  return () => {
    ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
  };
}, []);
```

This bit of example code shows how you might subscribe to a chat api. Notice that the function body does the subscription, and then we return a function that removes the subscription. Any function you return from a `useEffect` will be run when the component is unmounted. This is important to keep in mind to prevent memory leaks.

The other use-case is similar to the above, but for actions that do not require cleanup.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  someActionWeNeedToDoOnce();
}, []);
```

The above code will only be executed once when the component is rendered and never again.

Note that the second argument to useEffect is again an array of items that should trigger the effect to run again. If you don't want the effect to run again (and most of the time you don't), this should be an empty array `[]`. You should be especially careful about making sure you pass in the empty array if you use it for network request. Else you'll end up in an infinite loop!

‚òùÔ∏è you should run this on your phone or the in-browser emulator or you'll get CORS errors. In this example we do a network request to fetch some random cat facts when the component is rendered.
